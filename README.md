# Ants-Evolution-model
NetLogo model to simulate and analyze an environment where ants adapt and evolve.  
It has been realised in NetLogo 6.3.0.  

## Description
The system depicts a multi-agent model in which the various elements are able to evolve and adapt to the environment.  

### Environment
The environment is formed by a two-dimensional grid of patches of pre-established dimensions.  
Some patches have got a special role.  
- Nest patch: the ants' nest is the place were the food is brought, it is also the starting point for the agents.
- Food patch: this kind of patch represents the nourishment source, there are three food sources in total and every 70 steps one source is replenished.
In order to trigger the natural selection and the mechanism of evolution of the species, the environment applies a selective pressure on the agents.
